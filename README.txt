Smart Contracts by Tanuj Gupta
I have coded multiple Smart-Contracts using Remix IDE
Tools used - Remix IDE, Truffle, Solidity , Metamask , Ethereum networks , Hyperledger Framewokrs , Java , Docker , NPM , Javascript
Go to the contracts folder, you'll find the Solidity code for the smart contracts 
First is a PROPERTY TRANSFER contract - It has 3 functions and 3 return functions aswell. You can add a new Property name , property id , value , area of the property.
You can also Transfer property ownership 
Return functions provide property data ( above mentioned ) when property id is entered
