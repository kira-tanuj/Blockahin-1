Smart Contracts by Tanuj Gupta
I have coded multiple Smart-Contracts using Remix IDE
Tools used - Remix IDE, Truffle, Solidity , Metamask , Ethereum networks , Hyperledger Framewokrs , Java , Docker , NPM , Javascript
Go to the contracts folder, you'll find the Solidity code for the smart contracts 

PROPERTY TRANSFER contract - It has 3 functions and 3 return functions aswell. You can add a new Property name , property id , value , area of the property.
You can also Transfer property ownership 
Return functions provide property data ( above mentioned ) when property id is entered

Library Management - It is a contract created to help book managenment in huge libraries. Such big libraries face problems like missing books , pseudo customers , theft etc . Using Blockchain all these threats can be  neutralized. The library contract lets you add books to the network and data like book name , book issuer name , book author and price of the book. The return function tells you the above mentioned data when bookid is entered 


Decentralized E-KYC Network for Adhaar verification - I have created a decentralized network for doing kyc. It has more than 10 functions. Look for docx writeup for ekyc for complete details on the project 


Creating my own ERC20 Token - I have created my own ERC20 token and deployed it on the Ropsten network. It has muplitple fucntions in the contract itself like tranfer ownership , setting of initial supply , Burn tokens, send tokens to particular address, it also has a allowance function. This getter returns the remaining number of tokens that the spender will be allowed to spend on behalf of owner
